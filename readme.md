DOCUMENTATION:
1) Start by writing in the terminal npm init
2) Install all the required libraries using: npm install puppeteer express
3) Run npm run start in the terminal. 
4) Access on your browser http://localhost:4000
5) Enter the desired url that you want to scrape.

EXPLANATION:
As I began researching the best approach to accomplish the scraping tasks, I realized that Puppeteer, a Node.js library that offers a high-level API for controlling and automating headless Chrome, would be the most suitable option. Puppeteer is particularly well-suited for scraping and crawling projects.
I felt like Puppeteer was a more straight-forward approach for me and felt more comfortable using it. Cheerio and Axios could be two other choices.

While I hadn't previously undertaken a project like this and had only dabbled with Node.js a few times, I didn't let that discourage me. I embarked on a journey of research and learning, acquiring valuable new skills along the way. TThe research was intense and gave me a glimpse of just how powerful Node.js truly is.

Even if I'm not selected for the job, this opportunity has been incredibly rewarding. It allowed me to explore and master new technologies, pushing me beyond my comfort zone.
